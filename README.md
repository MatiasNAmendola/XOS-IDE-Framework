XOSIDE is an Online Code Editor for Javascript, HTML, PHP , CSS and XML
XOSIDE allows you to develop HTML5 applications directly online.

Thanks to the Codemirror library developed by Marijn Haverbeke (codemirror.net)
we have created an IDE online with everything you need for the development.  

Requirements
XOSIDE is compatible with browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera.
Some features such as upload files via drag and drop from your computer to XOSIDE File Browser, are only available for Chrome.
The server portion of XOSIDE was built with PHP 5.3.0. 

Installation
If you have a web site hosted on linux or windows platform with PHP 5.3.0 you already have everything you need.
After downloading Upload all files and folders via Ftp into a folder of your web space.

The default root path folder "Virtual Hard Disk" is "../XOSIDE_HD" ( remember to set the write permission to save your files into )

Open the "yourRemoteFolder/XOSIDE/config.php" file and read the instructions on how to create your username, your password and eventually your custom root path folder.

At that point open the index file: "yourRemoteFolder/XOSIDE/index_EN.php" with the browser.
Enter your username and your password into the form.
if everything is correctly configured, by clicking on the virtual hard drive you should see all the files (if presents) inside  your root path folder.
